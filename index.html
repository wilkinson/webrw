    <h1>WebRW</h1>

<p>This is a proxy tool that was originally written in PHP. The original version
is available <a href="https://github.com/ebadedude/webrw">here</a>. That tool had already
been ported to <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, but it had never been published
to <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a>. This project seeks to generalize the simple API
of the original for maximum portability, robustness, and scalability, but it is
not necessarily a drop-in replacement for the original.</p>
