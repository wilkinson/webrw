WebRW
=====

This is a proxy tool that was originally written in PHP. The original version
is available [here](https://github.com/ebadedude/webrw). That tool had already
been ported to [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), but it had never been published
to [NPM](https://npmjs.org/). This project seeks to generalize the simple API
of the original for maximum portability, robustness, and scalability, but it is
not necessarily a drop-in replacement for the original.
